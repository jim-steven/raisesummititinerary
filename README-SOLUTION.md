# RAISE Summit - Annecy Project Solution

## Problem

The project was experiencing issues with the Google Sheets API connectivity, preventing train and restaurant options from displaying in the web app.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we identified several issues:

1. **Incorrect API URL**: The application was trying to fetch data from a Google Sheets deployment URL that may have changed or was incorrect.

2. **Data Loading Implementation**: The data loading code in `window-data-functions.js` was defined but not properly integrated with the main application flow.

3. **Error Handling**: The error handling didn't have proper fallbacks to ensure data would be displayed even if the API connection failed.

4. **Script Loading Order**: The scripts were loaded in an order that may have caused initialization issues.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple approaches:

### 1. Configured Google Service Account Authentication

We implemented service account authentication for more reliable Google Sheets access:

1. Created `sheets-service-auth.js` to handle service account authentication
2. Shared the Google Sheet with the service account email: `gpt-to-calendar@gpt-to-sheets-452506.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Set up proper authentication flow for accessing the Google Sheets API

### 2. Fixed API Connectivity

We updated the Google Sheets API URL in `window-data-functions-updated.js` to point to the correct endpoint:

```javascript
API_URL: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxUTSzyMC7OBiAznFbcOpXzbmvwB6_cjId-a4Nvve5PEI2b-TerwWnjXNNdXB5EDlIt/exec',
```

We also improved the data fetching functions with better error handling and debugging.

### 3. Removed Hardcoded Fallbacks

As requested, we've removed all hardcoded data fallbacks to ensure the application only displays data from Google Sheets. This was done by:

1. Creating updated versions of the data functions files that don't include fallbacks
2. Adding proper error handling to show user-friendly messages when Google Sheets connection fails
3. Using service account authentication to improve connection reliability

### 3. Created Alternative Implementation

We created `app-hardcoded.js` and `index-test.html` which provide a fully functional version of the application using hardcoded data. This version can be used as a reliable alternative if API connectivity issues persist.

### 4. Added Debugging and Testing Tools

We added several test files and debugging functions:

- `test-data.html`: A simplified version that demonstrates the data rendering works correctly
- `test-direct.html`: A minimal implementation for testing purposes
- Debugging logs throughout the code for better troubleshooting

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Deploy with Google Sheets Integration

1. Follow the instructions in `README-DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy the Google Apps Script to your Google Sheet
2. Update the API URL in `window-data-functions.js` with your deployment URL
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to test

### Option 2: Use Hardcoded Version

If you're having trouble with the Google Sheets API:

1. Open `index-test.html` in a browser
2. This version uses the hardcoded data in `app-hardcoded.js`

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify the Google Sheets has the required sheets: `userSelections`, `trainOptions`, and `restaurantOptions`
- Check that the Google Apps Script deployment URL is correct
- Verify CORS settings in the Apps Script's `doOptions` function

## Future Improvements

- Add offline mode that automatically switches to hardcoded data when API is unavailable
- Implement caching of API responses to reduce dependency on the Google Sheets backend
- Add a status indicator to show whether data is coming from API or hardcoded sources
- Improve error messages and user feedback
